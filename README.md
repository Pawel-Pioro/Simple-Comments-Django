# Simple-Comments-Django

This is a simple django project that allows the user to post comments by logging in and posting their comment. This comment is added to a wall of other people's comments for anyone to view. The user can create a new account, log in and log out. It uses bootstrap for the frontend and the comments are saved to a sqlite3 database. 

I hosted the app on AWS. View it here: http://ec2-13-48-178-84.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/
